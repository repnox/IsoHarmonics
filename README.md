# IsoHarmonics

IsoHarmonics is a tool for designing perfect audio signals.
It's a synthesizer that exploits the power of the harmonic series and additive synthesis to create
perfect consonance (harmony) or perfect dissonance (percussion).
If you've ever wondered if there's more to music than the 12 keys on a piano, this software is for you!

Run the app for more details! It runs entirely in the browser and requires no back-end.

# Brunch Vue Barebones

This project was started following a template!
A _barebones_ Brunch skeleton for [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - minimal dependencies!
_Thanks to [https://github.com/nblackburn](@nblackburn) for his work on [vue-brunch](https://github.com/nblackburn/vue-brunch)_

## Getting Started

> Taken from the official Brunch docs

* Install (if you don't have them):
  * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org): `brew install node` on OS X
  * [Brunch](http://brunch.io): `npm install -g brunch`
  * Brunch plugins and app dependencies: `npm install`
* Run:
  * `npm start` — watches the project with continuous rebuild. This will also launch HTTP server with [pushState](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history).
  * `npm run build` — builds minified project for production
